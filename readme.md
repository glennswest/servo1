Servo Controller
Inspired by Roger Rabbit

This is a fully digital servo controller, using a ARM M0 from Atmel.
It designed for control via traditional pwm servo control, or optionally
from Grove/I2C as well. Note that it may also be possible to use serial
as will on the grove connector. 

This board is designed for 2 layers.
